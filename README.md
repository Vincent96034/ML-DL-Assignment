This repository contains all code files for the final assignment of the course 'Machine Learning & Deep Learning' at Copenhagen Business School. The respective data files are too large to upload into this repository - they can be found in the submitted .zip file.

## Structure

This repository is structured into 3 main notebooks. Additionally, there is the notebook `data_ops.ipynb` that includes all the data operations. Most Python functions and classes have been moved out of notebooks into dedicated `.py` files. Those can be found in the `common` module.

## Models
- Content-based Models: `CB_model.ipynb`
- Collaborative filtering: `CF_model.ipynb`
- Two Tower Neural Network: `2TM_model.ipynb`
